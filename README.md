# All the devOps?
I'm building things for real now, and want to demystify the processes of provisioning, securing, and deploying products. 

This repo will gather things I'm learning from several tools, including but not limited to:

* [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
* [Packer](https://www.packer.io/)
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
* [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Roadmap
I don't have a formal plan right now. I'm working from the bottom up, learning Ansible to configure servers I've already built. I'll move up the stack to Packer, Terraform, and AWS from there.

I also learned there's a difference in the terms "configure" and "provision" in the devOps space. Will try to be mindful and use the right term at the right time.
